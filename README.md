## Project Milestone 1: Definition

### Project overview
CarGo is an online used car transaction platform that provides historical price searching, reasonable price suggesting, car price comparison list among states for US sellers
and buyers who are unhappy with current insane used car market and sellers who raise prices arbitrarily.

### Features/capabilities:
 - Clients include car buyers, car sellers and administrators.
 - Car buyers and sellers can create accounts, delete accounts, edit accounts,  log in and log out an account.
 - Buyers can use our system to search cars by brand, make, type, year, color, cost etc.
 - Sellers can use our system to create user profiles including information on their companies and post sales information.
 - All users can query the historical transaction price of a certain car through our system. We try to provide users with transaction record data visualization or transaction record list.
 - Users can like, save and add cars they want to track to their favorite list.
 - Deploying our app on a website and connecting the backend with a cloud based database.
 - Users can query the MMR and the actual transaction price of the vehicle they are interested in, and we will try to calculate the preservation rate and other related information for the user.
 - Administrators have the availability to manage user accounts.
 - We will try to provide users with some leaderboards, such as the most searched models, the best-selling vehicles, and the models with the highest retention rates.
 - Since car prices vary from state to state, we provide SCPI (state car price index) for every state. Buyers can compare car prices based on this and help them to make decisions.
